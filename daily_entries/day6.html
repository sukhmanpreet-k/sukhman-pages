There are different types of agents based on how they are configured and where they run:<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Permanent Agents:</span><br>Permanent agents are long-lived worker nodes that are always online and connected to the Jenkins master.<br>These agents are pre-configured and available to handle build tasks at any time.<br>Permanent agents are suitable for stable environments where there is a consistent need for build and deployment capacity. These are suitable when there is a steady demand for build and deployment capacity. They are ideal for organizations with a stable infrastructure where agents can be consistently available.<br>eg : LINUX, WINDOWS.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Cloud Agents:</span><br>Cloud agents, also known as dynamic agents, are created on-demand in cloud environments (e.g., Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform) by Jenkins to handle fluctuating build workloads.<br>These agents are automatically provisioned when needed and terminated when the build or deployment tasks are completed.<br>Cloud agents allow Jenkins to scale up or down the build capacity based on the workload, saving resources when agents are not in use.  Cloud agents are beneficial when the workload varies over time or when there is a need for temporary build capacity. They are cost-effective since resources are provisioned only when needed and terminated when not in use.<br>eg : DOCKER, AWS, KUBERNETS.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
