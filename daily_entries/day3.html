It is a runtime environment that manages the creation and execution of Docker containers. The Docker Engine consists of three main parts:<br>Docker Daemon: The Docker daemon (dockerd) runs in the background and listens for Docker API requests. It manages the creation, execution, and monitoring of containers.<br>Docker CLI: The Docker CLI (Command-Line Interface) is the command-line tool used to interact with the Docker daemon. It provides commands to build, manage, and control Docker containers and images.<br>REST API: The Docker daemon exposes a RESTful API that allows other tools and services to interact with it programmatically.<br><br></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Docker Images:</span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> Docker images are the building blocks of containers. They are read-only templates or blueprints that contain the necessary files, libraries, dependencies, and instructions to create a container. Images are stored in a registry, such as Docker Hub, and can be pulled and pushed from different repositories.<br><br></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Docker Containers:</span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> Docker containers are the running instances of Docker images. They are isolated environments that encapsulate the application and its dependencies, providing consistent and reproducible execution. Containers are lightweight, portable, and can be started, stopped, and managed individually.<br><br></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Dockerfile:</span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions to build a Docker image. It specifies the base image, the files and directories to be copied, the dependencies to be installed, and the commands to be executed during the image build process. Dockerfiles provide a declarative and version-controlled approach to defining the image configuration.<br><br></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Docker Registry:</span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> Docker Registry is a central repository for storing and sharing Docker images. The default public registry is Docker Hub, but organizations can also set up their private registries to store and distribute images within their environment.<br><br></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Container Volumes:</span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> Docker provides a mechanism called volumes to manage persistent data and allow sharing of data between containers and the host system. Volumes can be attached to containers at runtime, allowing data to persist even when the container is stopped or restarted.<br><br></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Networking: </span><span style="font-size:11pt;">Docker provides networking capabilities that allow containers to communicate with each other and the external world. It offers different networking modes, such as bridge, host, and overlay, to facilitate connectivity and isolation between containers.<br><br></span><span style="font-size:11pt;font-weight:bold;">Container Orchestration:</span><span style="font-size:11pt;"> Docker can be integrated with container orchestration platforms like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes to manage and scale containers across multiple hosts. These platforms provide features for container deployment, service discovery, load balancing, and high availability.</span></td></tr><tr style="height: 382px"><th id="1199077947R19" style="height: 382px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 382px">20</div></th><td class="s7" dir="ltr">Task </td><td class="s9" dir="ltr">Different types of API&#39;s with its needs:- <br><br>There are several types of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), each serving specific needs and purposes based on the nature of the systems or services they interact with. Here are some common types of APIs and their respective needs:<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Web APIs:</span> Web APIs, also known as HTTP APIs or REST APIs, are designed to enable communication and data exchange between different web-based applications over the internet. They are widely used for web and mobile application development and provide a standard way of accessing and manipulating resources through HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Database APIs:</span> Database APIs, such as ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) or JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), provide an interface to interact with databases. They allow developers to execute queries, retrieve, insert, update, and delete data from a database system. These APIs ensure proper integration and efficient management of data in database-driven applications.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Operating System APIs:</span> Operating System APIs, also known as system APIs, are used by developers to interact with the underlying operating system. They provide a way to access system resources and perform tasks such as file operations, network communication, process management, and hardware control. Operating System APIs are crucial for developing system-level applications and utilities.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Library APIs:</span> Library APIs, also known as software APIs or SDKs (Software Development Kits), provide a set of pre-built functions and classes that developers can utilize to build applications. These APIs abstract complex functionalities, allowing developers to leverage existing code and tools to simplify development and accelerate time-to-market.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Hardware APIs:</span> Hardware APIs allow software applications to interact with specific hardware devices or components. They provide the necessary interfaces and protocols to control and access hardware functionalities such as sensors, cameras, printers, or microcontrollers. Hardware APIs are vital for developing applications that interact with physical devices.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Messaging APIs:</span> Messaging APIs facilitate communication and data exchange between different software systems or applications. They enable the exchange of messages or notifications in real-time, asynchronously, or through event-driven architectures. Messaging APIs are commonly used in chat applications, collaboration tools, or event-driven architectures like publish-subscribe systems.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Social Media APIs:</span> Social Media APIs, such as those provided by platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, allow developers to integrate their applications with social media platforms. These APIs enable functionalities like posting, sharing, retrieving user data, or interacting with social media features within applications.<br><br><span style="font-weight:bold;">Payment Gateway APIs:</span> Payment Gateway APIs provide integration with payment processing services, enabling businesses to accept online payments securely. They offer functionalities for processing payments, handling transactions, and managing payment-related operations such as refunds, subscriptions, or fraud detection.<br><br>The specific needs of APIs vary depending on the systems, platforms, or services they interact with. Developers choose the appropriate API type based on the requirements of their applications and the desired integration with external systems or services.<br></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
