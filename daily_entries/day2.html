It tracks modifications, allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project, and provides a history of changes made over time.<br>&quot;There are two main types of version control systems: centralized and distributed.<br><br>1. Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS): In a CVCS, there is a central repository that stores the entire history of the project. Developers check out files from the central repository, make changes locally, and then commit their changes back to the repository. Examples of CVCS include Apache Subversion (SVN) and Perforce.<br><br>2. Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS): In a DVCS, each developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its entire history. This allows developers to work offline and have more flexibility in branching and merging. DVCSs are generally considered more flexible and scalable than CVCSs. Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar are examples of DVCS.&quot;<br>&quot;1. Collaboration: VCS enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. They can work on different branches, merge their changes, and resolve conflicts efficiently.<br><br>2. History and Rollbacks: VCS maintains a complete history of changes made to the project. Developers can easily track modifications, revert to previous versions, and identify the author of each change.<br><br>3. Branching and Merging: VCS allows developers to create branches, which are independent lines of development. This feature enables teams to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Branches can be merged back to the main codebase when ready.<br><br>4. Backup and Recovery: VCS acts as a backup system since it stores all versions of the project. In case of data loss or corruption, developers can restore previous versions from the repository.<br><br>5. Traceability and Accountability: VCS provides a clear audit trail, allowing developers to see who made specific changes and when. This helps with issue tracking, debugging, and accountability.&quot;<br>&quot;Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different computers).<br> The basic Git workflow goes something like this:<br>1. You modify files in your working tree.<br>2. You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds only those changes to the staging area.<br>3.You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.&quot;<br>&quot;GitHub is a web-based version control and collaboration platform for software developers. Microsoft, the biggest single contributor to GitHub, acquired the platform for $7.5 billion in 2018.<br> Git is used to store the source code for a project and track the complete history of all changes to that code. It lets developers collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools for managing possibly conflicting changes from multiple developers.<br>GitHub allows developers to change, adapt and improve software from its public repositories for free, but it charges for private repositories, offering various paid plans.Each public and private repository contains all of a project&#39;s files, as well as each file&#39;s revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.&quot;<br>&quot;The following are some important terms GitHub developers use:<br><br>Fork:- A fork, also known as a branch, is a repository that has been copied from one member&#39;s account to another member&#39;s account. Forks and branches let a developer make modifications without affecting the original code.<br>Pull request:- If a developer would like to share their modifications, they can send a pull request to the owner of the original repository.<br>Merge:- If, after reviewing the modifications, the original owner would like to pull the modifications into the repository, they can accept the modifications and merge them with the original repository.<br>Push:- This is the reverse of a pull -- a programmer sends code from a local copy to the online repository.<br>Commit:- A commit, or code revision, is an individual change to a file or set of files. By default, commits are retained and interleaved onto the main project, or they can be combined into a simpler merge via commit squashing. A unique ID is created when each commit is saved that lets collaborators keep a record of their work. A commit can be thought of as a snapshot of a repository.<br>Clone:- A clone is a local copy of a repository.<br>&quot;<br>GitHub Desktop is an application that enables you to interact with GitHub using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser. GitHub Desktop encourages you and your team to collaborate using best practices with Git and GitHub. You can use GitHub Desktop to complete most Git commands from your desktop with visual confirmation of changes. You can push to, pull from, and clone remote repositories with GitHub Desktop, and use collaborative tools such as attributing commits and creating pull requests.<br>&quot;GitLab is a web-based Git repository that provides free open and private repositories, issue-following capabilities, and wikis. It is a complete DevOps platform that enables professionals to perform all the tasks in a project—from project planning and source code management to monitoring and security. Additionally, it allows teams to collaborate and build better software.<br>GitLab helps teams reduce product lifecycles and increase productivity, which in turn creates value for customers. The application doesn&#39;t require users to manage authorizations for each tool. If permissions are set once, then everyone in the organization has access to every component.&quot;<br>Git Pipeline provides an extensible set of tools for modeling build, testing and deploying code. All jobs in a stage are executed simultaneously and, if it succeeds, the pipeline moves on to the next stage.

Then finally fetch the code files of other team members into your own repository.<br>steps followed :- <br>1. write html code in vscode ( in the folder where you have cloned your repository)<br>2. push the code into github by using github desktop (use commit to main option and the push origin )<br>3. generate pull request ( pull request will go to owner of parent repository and owner will merge the pushed code into parent repository)<br>    go to github website, click on pull request, create new pull request, add comment and send the request.<br>4.after the request has been accepted by the owner, next step is to fetch files of your collegues into your repository.<br>5. for doing so, go to github desktop, click fetching origin. <br>6. go to branch, click merge into current branch, select upstream/main, and press create a merge commit.<br>7. finally push origin.&quot;<br>&quot;my github repository ~  https://github.com/sukhmanpreet-k/devops-1<br><br>parent rep</td></tr><tr style="height: 115px"><th id="546166349R3" style="height: 115px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 115px">4</div></th><td class="s2" dir="ltr">Git</td><td class="s4" dir="ltr">Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.
